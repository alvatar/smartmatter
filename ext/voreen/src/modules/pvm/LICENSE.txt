In order to compile the viewer under Linux simply type "build.sh" in a
shell. The viewer requires OpenGL and the GLUT library to be installed.

Under Windows either use the supplied Visual C++ project files
or use cygwin in the following way:

1. Download cygwin from http://cygwin.com
2. Run the installer program and make sure to select "Devel"
3. After the installation finishes, download the V^3 to somewhere useful
4. Unzip the V^3 package
5. Double-click the cygwin icon to get a bash session
6. In bash, type: "cd viewer" and "build.sh"

Volume datasets can be viewed by first converting the raw data to the
PVM format using the "raw2pvm" command line tool. PVM files can be
converted back to raw data with the complementary "pvm2raw" tool which
also prints information about the volume data. As an example PVM
dataset the famous Bucky Ball is contained within the package. In
order to view this dataset just type "v3 Bucky.pvm" on the console.

For best performance an NVIDIA GeForceFX or GeForce 4 is recommended.
On platforms without such a graphics accelerator the cross-section
viewer "pvmplay" can be used alternatively.

The V^3 package also contains the tools "pvminfo" and "pvm2pvm" which
amend a volume with additional information and quantize a 16 bit
volume to 8 bit using a non-linear mapping.

Have fun,
Stefan
