Created as part of the Quake project (tools for earthquake simulation).
Supported in part by NSF Grant CMS-9318163 and an NSERC 1967 Scholarship.
There is no warranty whatsoever.  Use at your own risk.


Triangle generates exact Delaunay triangulations, constrained Delaunay
triangulations, conforming Delaunay triangulations, Voronoi diagrams, and
high-quality triangular meshes.  The latter can be generated with no small
or large angles, and are thus suitable for finite element analysis.

Information on the algorithms used by Triangle, including complete
references, can be found in the comments at the beginning of the triangle.c
source file.  Another listing of these references, with PostScript copies
of some of the papers, is available from the Web page

If you use Triangle, and especially if you use it to accomplish real work,
I would like very much to hear from you.  A short letter or email (to
jrs@cs.berkeley.edu) describing how you use Triangle will mean a lot to me.
The more people I know are using this program, the more easily I can
justify spending time on improvements and on the three-dimensional
successor to Triangle, which in turn will benefit you.  Also, I can put you
on a list to receive email whenever a new version of Triangle is available.

If you use a mesh generated by Triangle or plotted by Show Me in a
publication, please include an acknowledgment as well.  And please spell
Triangle with a capital `T'!  If you want to include a citation, use

Generator and Delaunay Triangulator,'' in Applied Computational Geometry:

Computational Geometry.)'
