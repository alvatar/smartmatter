	<h1>.flow file format</h1>
	
	<h2>Abstract</h2>
	<p>In order to keep track of meta-data about a dataset containing flow data, the .flow file format has
	been introduced for the <em>Flowreen module</em> within <em>Voreen</em>.<br>
	.flow files consist basically of raw flow data stored as little endian single precision floating point values (floats) and
	an additional header. This document describes the structure of those files and how to read and write them.</p>
	
	<h2>File Format description</h2>
	<p>The stored data are usually linearized 2D or 3D arrays of floats. The dimension is denoted within the header.
	The files are (currently) designed to only contain floats and a single timestep of the flow, if it is not stationary
	and time-dependent.<br>
	If the flow data already exist in a .raw file, it is sufficient to add a header in order to make them accessible
	in the <emph>Voreen</emph> engine.<br>
	The structure of a .flow file in version 2 (current version on creation of this document) is as follows:</p>
	<table border="1">
		<tr>
			<td>file header (37 bytes)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>file content (n bytes of raw data)</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<p>The structure of the header for file version 2 in detail is as follows:</p>
	<table border="1">
		<tr>
			<td>start offset (byte)</td>
			<td>0 (0x00)</td>
			<td>11 (0x0B)</td>
			<td>15 (0x0E)</td>

			<td>20 (0x14)</td>
			<td>21 (0x15)</td>

			<td>2</td>
			<td>currently {1, 2, 3}</td>
			<td>0 - 5 (explanation see below)</td>
			<td>char {'x' | 'y' | 'z' | '\0'} or numerical value {0x78, 0x79, 0x7A, 0x00}</td>
			<td>unsigned int value > 0</td>
			<td>unsigned int value > 0</td>
			<td>unsigned int value > 0</td>
			<td>unsinged int value > 0</td>

	<p>The described three-dimensional flow has a bounding box of 128x128x32 (X x Y x Z), the 3D array is linearized
in XZY order (see below) and the order of the z-slices would be reversed when the file is loaded. The size of the data
results from the size of the bounding volume times the size of one float (usually 4 bytes on x86 machines): 
128 x 128 x 32 x 4 = 2097152 = 0x200000 bytes.</p>

			the current version of the flow file reader in <em>Voreen</em> can only deal with 3D flows! This
			field has been primarily introduced for future extensions.</td>

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><b>description</b></td>
			<td>Indicates in what order the formerly 3D array has been linearized. There are six possibilities for
			linearization a 3D array:
			<ul>
				<li>XYZ (code 1)</li>
				<li>XZY (code 0)</li>
				<li>YXZ (code 2)</li>
				<li>YZX (code 3)</li>
				<li>ZXY (code 4)</li>
				<li>ZYX (code 5)</li>
			</ul>
			For instance, code 0 (XZY) means, that the former volumetric data were conceptually slices in the XZ plane whereas the 
			x-axis is the first and the z-axis the second one, and that the slices where stacked in positive z-direction.<br>
			<i>Note: there is currently no case covering the linearization of 2D arrays for 2D flows!</i><br>
			<i>Note: the codes for XYZ and XZY are &quote;swapped&quote; for historical reasons :).</i>

			<td>It may be useful or necessary to reverse the conceptual slices along a certain direction of an 3D array.
			This can be achieved by setting the concerned axis in the slice reversal field. For instance, if the orignal
			array was in order of XYZ, the xy-slices will be reversed on loading the volume into <em>Voreen</em> if the
			slice reversal field is set to 'z'. Any other of the allowed values is possible, too, depending on the actual
			data.<br>
			Slice reversal will be omitted if the field contains the NULL-charactor (0x00).
			<i>Note: currently only the slice along one axis can be reversed, for it is sufficient in many cases.</i>

			knows how many bytes should be left for reading.
