/**
 * EventProperties are the usual way of accessing user-generated events in Voreen.
 *
 * Each EventProperty is assigned to an owner, usually a Processor, that has to specify the type
 * and configuration of events it intends to receive as well as the member function these events
 * will be passed to. The property may be configured to relay mouse events, key events
 * or both event types. EventProperties allow a Processor author to get access to user-generated
 * events in a convenient way, by performing three basic steps:
 *  - add a function for handling the desired events to the Processor
 *  - declare and create an EventProperty member object
 *  - announce the EventProperty object by passing it to Processor::addEventProperty
 *
 * @tparam T the type of the object whose member function is passed as event receiver
 *
 * @note An alternative way of receiving events is to overwrite Processor::onEvent.
 *       However, the usage of EventProperties is strongly recommended due to several reasons:
 *       - The standardized way of event access provided (or enforced) by the EventProperty class
 *         alleviates the development of user interfaces for the configuration of the event handling
 *         within a processor network, e.g. enabling/disabling certain event receivers or remapping input keys.
 *       - The set of event properties owned by a network's processors contains a significant amount
 *         of information about the event handling in the network, such as which processor reacts to which events.
 *       - EventProperties encourage to group the local event handling of a Processor into logical units,
 *         e.g. there may be one EventProperty whose associated member function handles a trackball navigation,
 *         while another EventProperty/member function pair is used for picking operations.
 *       For an example user interface exploiting the EventProperty concept for providing documentation
 *       as well as customization of the network event handling, see InputMappingDialog.
 *
 * @note Accepting an relayed event is up to the event property's owner. @see setSharing
 *
 * @see Processor::addEventProperty
 *
 * Implementation remarks: Any event generated by a canvas as reaction to a user interaction is propagated
 * through the network, starting at the canvas. A processor propagates each received event to
 * its EventProperties, before further propagating it to its predecessors in the network (Processor::onEvent).
