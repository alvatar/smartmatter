/**
 * \brief Manager class for picking plot objects.
 *
 * This class can convert tgt::col3 to a PlotData table position (row, column)
 * and vice versa.
 *
 * Table positions are interpreted as follows:
 * (-1,-1)       - no cell selected
 * (row, -1)     - entire row selected
 * (-1, column)  - entire column selected
 * (row, column) - single cell selected.
 *
 * The mapping of positions to colors is done as follows:
 * (0, 0, 0) adresses no cell.
 * A tgt::col3 has a size of (3*8)=24 bits, of which we reserve the lower
 * ceil(log_2(columnCount)) bits for the column index, the remaining bits
 * are usef for the row index.
 * The maximum number of cells which can be addressed with this encoding is
 * (2^24 - 1) = 16 777 215. In cases where columnCount is not a power of 2,
 * the maximum number of addressable cells will be less, but in any way be
 * at least (2^23 - 1) = 8 388 607.
 *
 * On exceeding these limits PlotPickingManager will raise an assertion
 * and set the color to (0, 0, 0).
