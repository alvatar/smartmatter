 * In this class there are some basic tools necessary to manipulate the TiXmlElement itself. A subclass should only
 * overwrite the NetworkConverter::convert(TiXmlElement*) method and don't add any other public methods.</br>
 * some outside method should care about specific version numbers and which NetworkConverter's method is to be called.</br>
 * Note: As far as this system is implemented now, the NetworkConverter doesn't check, if the version is really the one
 * it is meant for. So it might get jumbled up if the supervising class makes an error.</br>
 * This class presents one method called NetworkConverter::changeVersion(TiXmlNode*, int, int) which should be
 * called at the end of the overwritten NetworkConverter::convert(TiXmlElement*) method with the appropriate parameters.
